Tutorials
=========

Git and GitHub
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our learning plan is here: http://github.com/geocam/geocamDeveloperGuide/tree/master/git.rst

Django
~~~~~~

Read the intro and follow the tutorial: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/

HTML Reference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
One of the best HTML and CSS references available is the `Mozilla Developers Network <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs>`_

Javascript
~~~~~~~~~~
MDN has a nice, concise overview of the language: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript

If you're accustomed to object oriented languages with class-based inheritence, you might find this discussion of Javascript's prototype-based inheritence helpful: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Introduction_to_Object-Oriented_JavaScript

If you're interested in deeper understanding, Douglas Crockford's `talks <http://javascript.crockford.com/>`_ are highly recommended, as is his `book <http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do>`_. 

jQuery
~~~~~~

 * The `offical docs <http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page>`_ are very good.
 * Here's a tutorial with a general overview of the features: http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page
 * A great book on the subject is `JQuery in Action <http://www.amazon.com/jQuery-Action-Second-Edition-Bibeault/dp/1935182323/ref=dp_ob_title_bk>`_, which has a particularly good section on the event model Jquery uses (which abstracts away some of the browser-specific quirks in event dispatch). 

Google Maps API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The docs for version 3 of the Maps API live here:  https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/

**KML** is the XML schema used for through out Google's Map and Earth products for specifying geographic data.
The schema has `excellect documentation <https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference>`_ that you should become familiar with.

Ember.js
~~~~~~~~
  * First, read `Understanding Ember.Object <http://www.cerebris.com/blog/2012/03/06/understanding-ember-object/>`_

  * `Ember Homepage <http://emberjs.com/>`_ has getting-started text, guides, and auto-generated d0cs.
    
  * Recommended reading order:
        * `Intro docs <http://emberjs.com/documentation/>`_ 
        * `MVC Guide <http://emberjs.com/guides/ember_mvc/>`_
        * `Routing Guide <http://emberjs.com/guides/outlets/>`_
        * `The View Layer <http://emberjs.com/guides/view_layer/>`_

  * ember-data's `readme <https://github.com/emberjs/data>`_ is a pretty good run-down of how to use the persistance layer

  * `An alternative tour of the fulls stack <http://www.adobe.com/devnet/html5/articles/flame-on-a-beginners-guide-to-emberjs.html>`_ that I found very helpful.
  * `Tom Dale on debugging Ember <http://vimeo.com/37539737>`_ [video] offers a peak into the internals and developers' intent.

  Open questions:
    * `How should controllers be organized?  <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8664573/concerning-the-typical-behavior-of-controllers-in-ember>`_
    * `Support for nested JSON models in ember-data? <https://github.com/emberjs/data/issues/53>`_
