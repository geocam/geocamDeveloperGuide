Tutorials
=========

Git and GitHub
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our learning plan is here: http://github.com/geocam/geocamDeveloperGuide/tree/master/git.rst

Django
~~~~~~

Read the intro and follow the tutorial: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/

HTML Reference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
One of the best HTML and CSS references available is the `Mozilla Developers Network <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs>`_

Javascript
~~~~~~~~~~
MDN has a nice, concise overview of the language: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript

If you're accustomed to object oriented languages with class-based inheritence, you might find this discussion of Javascript's prototype-based inheritence helpful: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Introduction_to_Object-Oriented_JavaScript

If you're interested in deeper understanding, Douglas Crockford's talks are highly recommended: http://javascript.crockford.com/
As is his book: http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do

jQuery
~~~~~~

 * The `offical docs<http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page>`_ are very good.
 * Here's a tutorial with a general overview of the features: http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page
 * A great book on the subject is `JQuery in Action <http://www.amazon.com/jQuery-Action-Second-Edition-Bibeault/dp/1935182323/ref=dp_ob_title_bk>`_, which has a particularly good section on the event model Jquery uses (which abstracts away some of the browser-specific quirks in event dispatch). 

Google Maps API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/I
